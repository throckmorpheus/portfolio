Damsel's Gambit is a cross between a visual novel and a card game, where you combine 'topic' and 'action' cards to instigate conversations and affect characters' opinions of you.

The result of a cross-course university project, it is short but highly polished, acting as a full vertical slice of what it would be as a full release.

One of three technical team members, I served as lead programmer. We worked in the Godot engine using C#.

(Add something about how I also worked with design early on when we were figuring out the main mechanic)

(Add some description of the GDBridge episode)
